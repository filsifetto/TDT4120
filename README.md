# TDT4120 - Algorithms and Data Structures Playground

Welcome! This repository is where I'm documenting my journey learning algorithms and data structures, primarily through solving problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/). Feel free to follow along and see how I approach different problems - hopefully it'll be helpful if you're on a similar learning path!

## About

I'm working my way through the CSES Problem Set to build a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures. This repo contains my solutions, notes, and implementations as I learn. You'll see my thought process, different approaches I try, and how my understanding evolves over time. It's all here in the open, so you can learn alongside me or use it as a reference for your own practice.

## CSES Problem Set

The [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) is a collection of algorithmic programming problems that covers various topics including:

- **Introductory Problems** - Basic programming and problem-solving
- **Sorting and Searching** - Sorting algorithms, binary search, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming** - Classic DP problems and techniques
- **Graph Algorithms** - BFS, DFS, shortest paths, etc.
- **Range Queries** - Segment trees, Fenwick trees, etc.
- **Tree Algorithms** - Tree traversals, LCA, etc.
- **Mathematics** - Number theory, combinatorics, etc.
- **String Algorithms** - String matching, suffix arrays, etc.
- **Geometry** - Computational geometry problems
- **Advanced Techniques** - More complex algorithmic concepts

Each problem solution follows the naming convention: `problem_name.cpp` (or `.py`, `.java`, etc.), with optional problem number prefix for easy reference.

## What's This For?

This repository is a few things:

- **My Learning Log**: A place where I document how I solve problems and what I learn along the way
- **Learning Together**: If you're also learning algorithms, maybe you'll find some useful insights or approaches here
- **Reference**: A personal collection of implementations and techniques I can come back to
- **Progress Tracker**: A way to see how I'm progressing through different algorithmic topics

## My Approach

Here's how I'm tackling this learning journey:

- **Understanding First**: I try to really understand why something works, not just get the right answer
- **Try Before Looking**: I attempt to solve problems on my own before checking reference solutions
- **Write It Down**: I keep notes on my thought process, what worked, what didn't, and key insights
- **Keep Improving**: As I learn more, I come back and refine my solutions and understanding
