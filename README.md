# TDT4120 - Algorithms and Data Structures Playground

A personal playground repository for learning and practicing algorithms and data structures, with a focus on solving problems from [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).

## About

This repository serves as a collection of solutions and implementations for algorithmic problems, primarily from the CSES Problem Set. It's designed to help build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures through hands-on practice.

## CSES Problem Set

The [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) is a collection of algorithmic programming problems that covers various topics including:

- **Introductory Problems** - Basic programming and problem-solving
- **Sorting and Searching** - Sorting algorithms, binary search, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming** - Classic DP problems and techniques
- **Graph Algorithms** - BFS, DFS, shortest paths, etc.
- **Range Queries** - Segment trees, Fenwick trees, etc.
- **Tree Algorithms** - Tree traversals, LCA, etc.
- **Mathematics** - Number theory, combinatorics, etc.
- **String Algorithms** - String matching, suffix arrays, etc.
- **Geometry** - Computational geometry problems
- **Advanced Techniques** - More complex algorithmic concepts

Each problem solution follows the naming convention: `problem_name.cpp` (or `.py`, `.java`, etc.), with optional problem number prefix for easy reference.

## Usage

This repository is primarily for personal learning and practice. Feel free to:

- Add your own solutions to CSES problems
- Experiment with different algorithmic approaches
- Use it as a reference for algorithm implementations
- Track your progress through the CSES Problem Set

## Notes

- Solutions are organized for learning purposes
- Focus on understanding the algorithms rather than just solving problems
- Try to implement solutions from scratch before looking at references
- Document your thought process and approach for each problem
